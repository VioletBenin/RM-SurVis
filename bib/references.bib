   abstract = {Introduction: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder affecting children worldwide; however, diagnosing ADHD remains a complex task. Theta/beta ratio (TBR) derived from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings has been proposed as a potential biomarker for ADHD, but its effectiveness in children with ADHD remains controversial. Behavioral assessments, such as the Conners Continuous Performance Test–3rd edition (CPT-3), have been utilized to assess attentional capacity in individuals with ADHD. This study aims to investigate the correlation between TBR and CPT-3 scores in children and adolescents with ADHD. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, we examined patients regularly monitored for ADHD at Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, who underwent both EEG and CPT-3 assessments. Severity of ADHD was evaluated using parent- and teacher-completed Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP)-IV rating scales. Results: The study encompassed 55 ADHD patients (41 with abnormal CPT-3 scores, 14 with normal CPT-3 scores) and 45 control subjects. TBR demonstrated elevation in ADHD patients with abnormal CPT-3 scores, indicating its potential to represent attentional capacity akin to behavioral assessments like CPT-3. However, significant correlations between TBR values and CPT-3 variables or SNAP-IV rating scales were not observed. Moreover, TBR values exhibited considerable overlap across the groups, leading to diminished sensitivity and negative predictive value as a potential neurophysiological ADHD biomarker. Discussion: While our study underscores the utility of both TBR and CPT-3 in assessing attentional capacity, their sensitivity in diagnosing ADHD is limited. A comprehensive evaluation, integrating clinical expertise, parental input, and detailed neuropsychometric tests, remains pivotal for a thorough and precise diagnosis of ADHD.},

   abstract = {This study explores how EEG connectivity measures in children with ADHD ages 7–10 (n = 140) differ from an age-matched nonclinical database. We differentiated connectivity in networks, Brodmann area pairs, and frequencies. Subjects were in the International Collaborative ADHD Neurofeedback study, which explored neurofeedback for ADHD. Inclusion criteria were mainly rigorously diagnosed ADHD and a theta/beta power ratio (TBR) ≤ 4.5. Using statistical and machine learning algorithms, connectivity values were extracted in coherence, phase, and lag coherence at all Brodmann, subcortical, and cerebellar areas within the main networks in all EEG frequencies and then compared with a normative database. There is a higher rate of dysregulation (more than ± 1.97SD), in some cases as much as 75%, of the Brodmann pairs observed in coherence and phase between BAs 7, 10, and 11 with secondary connections from these areas to BAs 21, 30, 35, 37, 39, and 40 in the ADHD children as compared to the normative database. Left and right Brodmann areas 10 and 11 are highly disconnected to each other. The most dysregulated Brodmann Areas in ADHD are 7, 10, and 11, relevant to ADHD executive-function deficits and provide important considerations when developing interventions for ADHD children.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Several studies have indicated that electroencephalography (EEG) and microstates analysis are promising in the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis. However, these studies are restricted to analyzing the temporal dynamics of microstates; therefore, the syntax of symbolic microstates sequences in ADHD patients has not been explored. To solve this gap, this paper proposes a new methodology for the detection of ADHD using EEG microstate analysis and natural language processing. Method: This method enables to capture the contextual information of symbolic microstates sequence using Word2vec and model each microstate as a numerical vector. The characteristics derived from these embedding vectors were used to train a neural artificial network to classify patients with ADHD and subtypes. Results: The proposed method was able to classify ADHD patients with mean accuracy of 99.06% and was also able to identify ADHD subtypes with mean accuracy of 95.56%. In addition, the proposed approach was able to identify and visualize the most relevant symbolic microstates context becoming a useful tool in ADHD diagnosis. Conclusion: The results indicate that contextual features of symbolic microstates sequence captured by Word2vec achieve better classification results when compared to classical microstates analysis and theta to beta ratio (TBR) frequency analysis. Then, the proposed method is promising to identify ADHD and subtypes.},

   abstract = {Developing biomarkers for a complex neurodevelopmental disorder such as the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a challenging task since it is a multifactorial and multi-faceted condition. Researchers have been employing different sensing modalities to acquire measurements of the condition, however, there has been a lack of approaches that can adequately combine the multimodal data and detect interactions among the modalities. To demonstrate the concept and benefit of multimodal biomarker discovery, we conducted a multimodal data collection targeting the ADHD condition and demonstrated how a rule-based exploratory analysis approach could be used to analyze the data. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to explore and identify interesting interactions among two modalities of data, eye movement data and the EEG signal, for multimodal biomarker discovery for ADHD. The detection of these interactions would help us better understand the condition and develop better prediction models and intervention strategies.},

   abstract = {Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been associated with atypical patterns of neural activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG). However, the identification of EEG diagnostic biomarkers has been complicated by the disorder's heterogeneity. The objective of this review was to synthesize the literature investigating EEG variation in patients diagnosed with ADHD, addressing the following questions: 1) Are the diagnostic ADHD subtypes associated with different EEG characteristics? 2) Are EEG measures correlated with ADHD traits and/or symptom severity? and 3) Do classification techniques using EEG measures reveal different clinical presentations of ADHD? Outcomes highlight the potential for electrophysiological measures to provide meaningful insights into the heterogeneity of ADHD, although direct translation of EEG biomarkers for diagnostic purposes is not yet supported. Key measures that show promise for the discrimination of existing ADHD subtypes and symptomatology include: resting state and task-related modulation of alpha, beta and theta power, and the event-related N2 and P3 components. Prescriptions are discussed for future studies that may help to bridge the gap between research and clinical application.},

   abstract = {Adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been described as having altered resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral power and theta/beta ratio (TBR). However, a recent review (Pulini et al. 2018) identified methodological errors in neuroimaging, including EEG, ADHD classification studies. Therefore, the specific EEG neuromarkers of adult ADHD remain to be identified, as do the EEG characteristics that mediate between genes and behaviour (mediational endophenotypes). Resting-state eyes-open and eyes-closed EEG was measured from 38 adults with ADHD, 45 first-degree relatives of people with ADHD and 51 unrelated controls. A machine learning classification analysis using penalized logistic regression (Elastic Net) examined if EEG spectral power (1–45 Hz) and TBR could classify participants into ADHD, first-degree relatives and/or control groups. Random-label permutation was used to quantify any bias in the analysis. Eyes-open absolute and relative EEG power distinguished ADHD from control participants (area under receiver operating characteristic = 0.71–0.77). The best predictors of ADHD status were increased power in delta, theta and low-alpha over centro-parietal regions, and in frontal low-beta and parietal mid-beta. TBR did not successfully classify ADHD status. Elevated eyes-open power in delta, theta, low-alpha and low-beta distinguished first-degree relatives from controls (area under receiver operating characteristic = 0.68–0.72), suggesting that these features may be a mediational endophenotype for adult ADHD. Resting-state EEG spectral power may be a neuromarker and mediational endophenotype of adult ADHD. These results did not support TBR as a diagnostic neuromarker for ADHD. It is possible that TBR is a characteristic of childhood ADHD.},

   abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic heritable developmental delay psychiatric disorder requiring chronic management, characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, hyperkinectivity and impulsivity. Subjective clinical evaluation still remains crucial in its diagnosis. Discussed are two key aspects in the “characterizing ADHD” and on the quest for objective “pathognomonic/endophenotypic diagnostic markers of ADHD”. The first aspect briefly revolves around issues related to identification of pathognomonic/endophenotypic diagnostic markers in ADHD. Issues discussed include changes in ADHD definition, remission/persistence and overlapping-symptoms cum shared-heritability with its co-morbid cross-border mental disorders. The second aspect discussed is neurobiological and EEG-based studies on ADHD. Given the neurobiological and temporal aspects of ADHD symptoms the electroencephalograph (EEG) like NeuralScan by Medeia appears as an appropriate tool. The EEGs appropriateness is further enhanced when coupled with suitable behavior/cognitive/motor/psychological tasks/paradigms yielding EEG-based markers like event-related-potential (ERPs like P3 amplitudes and latency), reaction time variability (RTV), Theta:Beta ratio (TBR) and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR). At present, these markers could potentially help in the neurobiological characterization of ADHD and either help in identifying or lay the groundwork for identifying pathognomonic and/or endopheno-typic EEG-based markers enabling its diagnosis, treatment and management.},

   abstract = {Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous condition for which multiple efforts to characterize brain state differences are underway. The objective of this study was to identify distinct subgroups of resting electroencephalography (EEG) profiles among children with and without ADHD and subsequently provide extensive clinical characterization of the subgroups. Methods: Latent class analysis was used with resting state EEG recorded from a large sample of 781 children with and without ADHD (N = 620 ADHD, N = 161 Control), aged 6–18 years old. Behavioral and cognitive characteristics of the latent classes were derived from semistructured diagnostic interviews, parent completed behavior rating scales, and cognitive test performance. Results: A five-class solution was the best fit for the data, of which four classes had a defining spectral power elevation. The distribution of ADHD and control subjects was similar across classes suggesting there is no one resting state EEG profile for children with or without ADHD. Specific latent classes demonstrated distinct behavioral and cognitive profiles. Those with elevated slow-wave activity (i.e. delta and theta band) had higher levels of externalizing behaviors and cognitive deficits. Latent subgroups with elevated alpha and beta power had higher levels of internalizing behaviors, emotion dysregulation, and intact cognitive functioning. Conclusions: There is population-level heterogeneity in resting state EEG subgroups, which are associated with distinct behavioral and cognitive profiles. EEG measures may be more useful biomarkers of ADHD outcome or treatment response rather than diagnosis.},

   abstract = {Aim of the study: To investigate the frequency domain effects and changes in electroencephalography (EEG) signals in children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Patients and methods: The study contains 40 children. All children were between the ages of 7 and 12 years. Participants were classified into four groups which were ADHD (n=20), ADHD-I (ADHD-Inattentive type) (n=10), ADHD-C (ADHD-Combined type) (n=10), and control (n=20) groups. In this study, the frequency domain of EEG signals for ADHD, subtypes and control groups were analyzed and compared using Matlab software. The mean age of the ADHD children's group was 8.7 years and the control group 9.1 years. Results: Spectral analysis of mean power (μV2) and relative-mean power (%) was carried out for four different frequency bands: delta (0--4 Hz), theta (4--8 Hz), alpha (8--13 Hz) and beta (13--32 Hz). The ADHD and subtypes of ADHD-I, and ADHD-C groups had higher average power value of delta and theta band than that of control group. However, this is not the case for alpha and beta bands. Increases in delta/beta ratio and statistical significance were found only between ADHD-I and control group, and in delta/beta, theta/delta ratio statistical significance values were found to exist between ADHD-C and control group. Conclusion: EEG analyzes can be used as an alternative method when ADHD subgroups are identified.},

New method: In this work we present the findings of a method which obviates such assumptions and aims at a comprehensive analysis of the averaged EEG/ERP signal. Results: For the sake of demonstration we chose the established go/no-go paradigm in the context of ADHD. Our analysis method characterized two spatiotemporally distinct neurophysiologic processes which underlie the sampled signal: one which may be related to attention and the other which may be more related to perception. Comparison with existing method(s): We show how these processes accord with and provide insight on the waveforms reported in the literature. Conclusions: Finally we suggest that application of our method on averaged EEG/ERP data sampled from other paradigms may point at a similarly parsimonious set of underlying neurophysiologic processes which underlie the signal.},
